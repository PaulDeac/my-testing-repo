# Errors

## HTTP Response Codes

This specification makes rules about the use of specific HTTP status codes in particular circumstances where the status codes SHALL map to particular states correctly, and only where the correct status code is not obvious. Other HTTP status codes may be used for other states as appropriate, and this particularly includes various authentication related status codes and redirects. Authentication redirects should not be interpreted to change the location of the resource itself.
FHIR®  defines an OperationOutcome resource that can be used to convey specific detailed processable error information. For a few combinations of interactions and specific return codes, an OperationOutcome is required to be returned as the content of the response. The OperationOutcome may be returned with any HTTP 4xx or 5xx response, but is not required - many of these errors may be generated by generic server frameworks underlying a FHIR®  server.

## IANA Defined HTTP Status Codes

http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml


The IANA HTTP Status Codes listed below describes HTTP responses that may be processed by the integration layer without accessing the OLIS solution. As a result, OperationOutcome resources would not be returned in these cases.
